# My_Diploma_Project(python)

<p>This is a drones-fighting game where a player has to write his own drones logic so they defeat the enemy and gather all the resources on the map</p>
<p>The aim of the project was to analyze the logic of the basic drones (code) kept in the file named devastator.py 
without any previous knowledge of the game and write your own logic so it defeats devastators drones and other players if there are any</p>
<p>If you would like to participate and try it out, just run game.py file in your environment and see how it works, the next step is to analyse drones' code and write your own. Good luck!&#9994;&#x1F3C5;</p>
